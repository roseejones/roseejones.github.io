            <p>
                As a seasoned machine learning professional with 9 years of experience, I have a proven track record of
                driving business growth through data-driven solutions. My expertise spans across a range of industries,
                from retail, travel and hospitality to manufacturing and education. I have a strong business and
                technical background with three master's degrees (MSc in Computer Science, MSc in Data Science, and MSc
                in Business Administration with a focus on International Business). Having lived and worked extensively
                throughout Europe, Asia, and America, I bring a unique perspective on global markets and cultures.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my previous role at a travel technology unicorn startup in South Korea, I led a cross-functional team
                to achieve a 90x revenue growth for the company. Through advanced analytics and data modeling, I
                improved customer satisfaction by 20%, reduced costs by 15%, and increased efficiency by 30%.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my current role, my duties encompass leading teams of engineers and data scientists, developing and
                implementing scalable machine learning solutions, and driving projects that improve customer
                satisfaction and operational efficiency. I am responsible for designing and maintaining machine learning
                pipelines, creating predictive models, and ensuring seamless collaboration between business and
                technical teams. Additionally, I oversee the integration of machine learning frameworks, manage project
                budgets, and uphold data governance standards.
            </p>
            <p>
                I always bring new perspectives to solving problems. Ideally, I am looking for an AI/ML
                engineering position to get more exposure in advancing the state of the art where I can make an impact
                in changing the world.
