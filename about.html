            <p>
                I didn't take the traditional path into engineering. I started in business development and marketing,
                learning how to listen, shape strategy, and connect ideas to outcomes. That foundation eventually led
                me into tech - and now, nearly a decade into engineering, it's clear that detour is what defines
                how I build.
            </p>
            <p>
                My background spans linguistics (BS), business (MBA), data science (MS), and computer science (MS).
                It wasn't a master plan - but it gave me a systems view of problems: how language, data,
                software, and business intent intersect to create products that actually work in the real world.
            </p>
            <p>
                As an engineering lead, my focus is straightforward: ship products that matter. I work closely with
                stakeholders to turn ambiguity into clear requirements, translate complex data into decisions, and
                guide teams toward scalable, well-architected solutions - often powered by AI. I sit naturally
                at the intersection of engineering, data science, and business strategy, not because it's trendy,
                but because it's effective.
            </p>
            <p>
                We're now firmly in the GenAI era - and the standard for engineering has changed. One curious,
                resourceful engineer can now deliver what once required an entire team. Iteration loops are finally
                fast. Agile is no longer a theory - it's the default. Engineers are no longer just implementers;
                everyone is an architect and a product builder.
            </p>
            <p>
                That shift comes with new challenges. AI can generate code faster than humans can reasonably review,
                making traditional TDD daunting if approached naively. The answer isn't to slow down - it's to
                be systematic. Place tests where they matter. Encode requirements and acceptance criteria directly
                into evaluation, validation, and automation pipelines. That's where I excel.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm particularly strong at automating these workflows so teams move fast without sacrificing
                correctness. When teams struggle with velocity, it's rarely an execution problem - it's a
                specification problem. If the vision exists, engineering leaders are responsible for architecting it
                clearly. With AI, clarity is leverage.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm deeply curious, always experimenting, and grounded in first-principles thinking. Above all, I
                believe great products come from strong teams - built on trust, ownership, and pride in what
                we ship. It's not about perfection; it's about momentum and impact.
