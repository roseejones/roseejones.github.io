  title: Forecasting S&P500 Market Direction using Technical Indicators and ML Algorithms
  url: https://github.com/silverrainb
  github_url: https://github.com/silverrainb
  description: This research applies and analyses the effectiveness of Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine (XGBoost implementation), Multi-Layer Perceptron, and Recurrent Neural Network Long Short-Term Memory in the context of statistical trading. In this research, we summarize the differences of these models from a technical point of view and compare their performance using metrics for classification accuracy. Each model is trained on returns of the S&P 500 index price from 1983 to 2019 with multiple lagged periods. All training processes use nested cross validation and random coarse to fine hyperparameter tuning. The day over day market direction is predicted based on the feature-engineered variables and momentum-based technical indicators.
