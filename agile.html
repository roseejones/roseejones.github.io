        <p>
            I constantly seek opportunities to contribute to advancements in the field and I am eager to make a positive
            impact wherever I am. I am passionate about agile software development. I've dedicated significant portions of
            my career to championing its principles and being a change agent in organizations. Acting as a lead within
            various projects, I've seamlessly integrated agile methodologies into our workflow, fostering collaboration,
            efficiency, and adaptability. Along the way, I've also taken on responsibilities in product management, ensuring
            that our development efforts align closely with clients needs and strategic objectives. My journey in agile
            development has been marked by a commitment to continuous improvement and a relentless pursuit of excellence. I
            thrive in environments where cross-functional teams collaborate closely, driving innovation and delivering value
            at a rapid pace.

        <p>
            Scrum is over 2 decades old and there is a large body of knowledge around it and agile methodologies. Before we want to challenge the method, let's study established practice and follow the principles.
        </p>
        <ul>
            With that, here is my summary of "Scrum is simple": <br>
            <li><b>Story estimate: </b>Consider estimated effort as time + uncertainties. How much time will this ticket
                require for me to complete? + What is the level of risk? What are the unknowns or dependencies?</li>
            <li><b>Value: </b>Business value of the story: This number should be used to prioritize the stories
                This is where we need product manager or engineering manager's input. These values turn into "Earned Value"
                when completed and can be data points for project management down the road.</li>
            <li><b>Priorities: </b>Best bargain for the time is the story that has a high value + low story points.</li>
            <li><b>Spike: </b>Spike does not produce any production code. Spike should be time boxed to hours or days. When
                the engineer runs out of the boxed time, he/she should report back to the team. The owner spent the
                allotment in the spike for the sprint. If more investigation is needed, the team should create a new spike
                and put it in the following sprint. If we really need the answers now, then we move some of the stories in
                the current sprint out and pull in the spike. Spike is time boxed to control how much effort goes into this
                "less well defined task". Spike tickets should list questions to answer. Spike acceptance criteria should be
                documentation at a specified location. The time box prevents the spike from eating up the entire sprint. If
                we time box a spike to 3 days, we can point it with the equivalent of that many man-days of capacity.</li>
            <li><b>Prototype :</b>Gloss over details and focus in on specific aspects of the system being considered.
                <ul>
                    <li><b> - Correctness: </b>You may be able to use dummy data where appropriate.</li>
                    <li><b> - Completeness:</b>Prototype function only in a very limited sense perhaps with only one
                        pre-selected piece of input data.</li>
                    <li><b> - Robustness:</b>Error checking is likely to be incomplete or missing entirely.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Velocity: </b>Velocity is a measurement of how many of the points we estimated were completed. For this
                reason, we strictly follow scrum practice. We avoid breaking stories into part 1,2,3 sequence or break
                points by cloning them. This is not required unless you are paid by hours. Ask yourself, What value did you
                deliver? Points are added to the velocity when the value of the story is delivered.</li>
            <li><b>Definition of Ready (DoR) and Done (DoD): </b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b> - </b>Consider DoR and DoD as contracts for the team. Once we estimate, we as a team are signed
                        up for that amount of work to complete within the sprint duration.</li>
                    <li><b> - </b>Feel empowered to speak up to amend the stories during refinement - do you think our
                        contract is wrong? Is this story clear enough that I would sign a contract on it?</li>
                    <li><b> - </b>Use definition of done for reviews</li>
                    <li><b> - </b>During refinement session, take a look at DoR and see if everything meets the standards
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Sprint Operation</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b> -</b>Sprint is a team commitment - we commit to certain amount of work to be done within the
                        sprint (10 days). As a team, we need to come together to help each other when we get blocked. Toward
                        the end of the sprint, if there aren't many tickets left, the team should practice pair programming
                        to get the rest through - this way, we accelerate ticket completion as well as get exposed to
                        broader expertise.
                    </li>
                    <li><b> -</b>Scrum ceremony runs full day of meeting every two weeks on sprint transition day with demo,
                        retro, and planning, in order.</li>
                    <li><b> -</b>Sprint planning is where we make our commitment. We promise the business that these planned
                        tickets will be delivered in 2 weeks. To business, it's better to show them "done" than promising
                        something is under way. We want to work as a team to get more "completion" than more "starts". This
                        is better for the business and it builds better perception for the team.
                    </li>
                    <li><b> -</b>Say if We are on the last day of the sprint but there is 1 ticket left that's not
                        completed. What to do? We should get on a call together and do our best to close it by the end of
                        the day. Not doing so shows that we lack team commitment.</li>
                    <li><b> -</b>High performing teams expect to run out of tickets by the last day of the sprint. Often
                        they use this time for innovation - work on trying out interesting techniques you read or heard
                        about, or do housekeeping to be ready for the next sprint. It's used as "reset" time. We need to get
                        off the treadmill occasionally.</li>
                    <li><b> -</b>If we run out of tickets more than a day - we should revisit team capacity and pull in
                        additional work from the planned backlog.</li>
                    <li><b> -</b>For scheduling, refinement runs 2nd week of Tuesday for 2~4 hours.</li>
                    <li><b> -</b>Consider total engineers' time. Start/end of sprint ceremony with meetings can
                        significantly reduce pure work hours. Preserve dev time as much as possible.</li>
                    <li><b> -</b>Always ask availability before start planning - PTOs, trainings, etc
                    <li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Sprint Board</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b> -</b>Developer should have only 1 ticket active in current board. More than 1 "In Progress"
                        ticket is a smell - there is something unlikely about it.</li>
                    <li><b> -</b>When stories don't complete, use the Jira function to move them to a suggested sprint (i.e.
                        next sprint, planned, planning, blocked, archived), instead of "removing" them from the sprint
                        manually. This way, we are able to track and do retro to set up improvement plan. There is no reason
                        to remove from the sprint unless we are swapping with something else.</li>
                    <li><b> -</b> Once this is done, the carried over story will show all related sprint in the ticket
                        property.</li>
                    <li><b> -</b>We should stick to sprint operation schedule. If national holidays overlap, carry over the
                        day before.</li>
                    <li><b> -</b>Burndown Chart: Ideally we want our burn down chart to show gradual decrease.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Retrospective</b></li>
            <li><b>Celebrate the win</b></li>
        </ul>
